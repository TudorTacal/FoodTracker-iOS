### Food Tracker

This projects was done during the Christmas holiday while attending Makers Academy coding bootcamp.

It is an iOS app that allows an user to add a meal with a photo and give it a rating.

This was the first time I used Xcode and Swift to build a project. So I found the [Food Tracker](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/) tutorial very helpful for getting a quick understanding of how an iOS app takes birth.

Considering the fact that I followed the tutorial to build the app I still found it challenging to understand the complexities involved in building even a simple app like this one.  

But I found that Swift is a solid programming language and Xcode a very intuitive and simple to use IDE.



## Installation and use

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open the **FoodTracker.xcodeproj** in Xcode.
3. Run the app in the simulator.

## Technologies used

* **Xcode 8**
* **Swift**
